  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "How much can I save on my business gas bills?",
      answer: "Business gas savings typically range from 25-40% depending on your current contract, consumption levels, and business type. Manufacturing businesses with high usage often achieve the highest absolute savings, while smaller commercial premises see significant percentage reductions. Our average client saves Â£1,800 annually on gas costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Will switching gas suppliers affect my gas supply reliability?",
      answer: "No, switching gas suppliers has no impact on supply reliability. Your local gas distribution network continues to deliver gas through the same pipes and infrastructure. Only the billing supplier changes - the physical gas supply remains completely unaffected and is regulated by Ofgem for continuity."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to switch business gas suppliers?",
      answer: "The standard business gas switching process takes 17-21 working days from contract signature. If you're currently in a fixed-term contract, we can arrange the switch to coincide with your contract expiry to avoid any early termination penalties."
    },
    {
      question: "What gas supply information do I need for a quote?",
      answer: "You'll need a recent gas bill showing your MPRN (Meter Point Reference Number), annual consumption (kWh), current unit rates, standing charges, and any contract end dates. We also need basic business information about your premises type and operational requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there charges for your gas comparison service?",
      answer: "Our business gas comparison service is completely free with no charges to you. We receive commission payments directly from gas suppliers when you switch, but this doesn't affect the rates you pay. There are no hidden fees, setup costs, or ongoing service charges."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I switch if I'm in a current gas contract?",
      answer: "If you're in a fixed-term gas contract, you'll generally need to wait until it expires to avoid termination fees. However, we can review your contract terms and in some cases, the savings from switching early may exceed the exit costs. We'll provide a detailed cost-benefit analysis."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my gas supplier goes out of business?",
      answer: "If your gas supplier fails, Ofgem automatically appoints a 'Supplier of Last Resort' to take over your supply. Your credit balance is protected under the Energy Market Malpractice regulations, and you can then choose a new supplier. Gas supply is never interrupted during this process."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer green gas options for businesses?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer various green gas options including biomethane, renewable gas certificates, and carbon offset programs. These sustainable gas solutions help businesses reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining competitive pricing for their heating and operational needs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with industrial gas contracts for manufacturing?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We specialize in high-volume industrial gas contracts for manufacturing, processing, and energy-intensive operations. These contracts feature volume-based pricing, flexible terms, and industrial-specific clauses like interruption rights and load profiling."

              What is Business Gas Procurement?
            </h2>
            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <p className="text-xl mb-6">
                Business gas procurement involves sourcing natural gas supplies for commercial, industrial, and institutional 
                operations at competitive rates through the UK's deregulated gas market. Unlike domestic gas switching, 
                commercial gas contracts require sophisticated analysis of usage patterns, seasonal demands, and operational requirements.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The UK business gas market was fully deregulated in 1998, creating competition among suppliers and enabling 
                businesses to negotiate bespoke contracts. Today, over 25 licensed gas suppliers compete for commercial customers, 
                offering various contract structures from simple fixed-rate agreements to complex industrial supply arrangements 
                with load profiling and interruption clauses.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Commercial gas pricing comprises several elements including wholesale gas costs (typically 40-50% of the bill), 
                network transportation charges, government levies, and supplier margins. The complexity of these pricing components 
                means that apparent unit rate comparisons can be misleading without detailed contract analysis.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Professional gas brokers like Watt Energy Solutions understand the nuances of commercial gas procurement, 
                including optimal contract timing, supplier credit assessment, and risk management. We leverage market intelligence 
                and supplier relationships to secure rates and terms that businesses typically cannot access independently, 
                while providing ongoing contract management and market monitoring services.
